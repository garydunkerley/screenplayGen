                             GEORGE
               Why is there no haggling in this country?

               I guess we like to think we've progressed 
               beyond a knife fight for a
 
               
               citrus drink.

               
                             GEORGE
               Not me. Everything should be negotiable.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Restaurants too?

               
                             GEORGE
               Absolutely. You're telling me there's 
               no room to move on pasta.
 
               
               All starches are a scam.

               
                             JERRY
               Yea especially zedi(???), with that 
               big hole.
 
               
               (George asks the store worker a question)

               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, how much is this?

               Dollar nineteen.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'll give you a quarter.

               
                             WORKER
               Get the hell out of here.

               
                             JERRY
               Tell him forty and no fork.

               That's it you leave and never come back!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               How about we leave and come back in 
               a week?
 
               
                             WORKER
               Deal!

               
                             GEORGE
               Alright see? We got something there.

               the new chicken
 
               
               shack. ( I came in a little late.))

               Look at the size of that neon light.

               Roger's can't sell chicken around here, 
               we got chicken places on
 
               
               every block.

               At least.

               
                             JERRY
               You wanna grab lunch?

               
                             SETH
               Uh, I'm actually headed back to the 
               office.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Seth it's me. What's more important 
               than catching up with an old
 
               
               college buddy?

               
                             SETH
               Well, I am supposed to be in this meeting.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How 
               many of those did we go to?
 
               
                             SETH+JERRY
               Alright, alright.

               
                             JERRY
               Whatever happened to Moochie?

               He's dead.

               
                             JERRY
               Is that right?

               
               (George and Elaine are in a store )

               
                             GEORGE
               I still don't understand how you can 
               call lunch with me a business
 
               
               expense.

               
                             ELAINE
               What do you think of the catalog?

               
                             GEORGE
               It stinks.

               
                             ELAINE
               There, we just talked business.

               
                             WORKER
               We do have the down comforter and the 
               cookware you liked.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh great, put it all on the Peterman 
               account with the other stuff.
 
               
                             WORKER
               You know what else we have that you 
               might like?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I'll take it.

               
               (George puts on a giant Russian hat)

                             WORKER
               I think that looks very nice on you.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Really? Elaine...Peterman account?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Why not? (To worker) And some hair for 
               my little friend here.
 
               
               (Jerry and Seth are eating at a restaurant)

               So how's your stand up career?

               
                             JERRY
               Pretty good, as a matter of fact. I 
               almost had my own show in Japan.
 
               
                             SETH
               You speak Japanese?

               
                             JERRY
               No

               
                             SETH
               So you would have done it in Japan, 
               but in English.
 
               
               (Jerry thinks for a minute)

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. So what's this job of 
               yours?
 
               
                             SETH
               Big investment firm. We just got the 
               Citibank account. In fact today

                             JERRY
               The meeting you blew off?

               
               (Seth laughs)

               
                             SETH
               Yea.

               
                             JERRY
               Wasn't that kind of important?

               
               ( Seth pauses to think, and then gets worried.)

               
                             SETH
               Yea.

               
               (Jerry and Elaine are talking on the phone)

               
                             ELAINE
               ...and I brought I whole new set of 
               cookware, and a water pic.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You use a water pick?

               
                             ELAINE
               Sure, water pic, floss, plax, brush, 
               listerine...
 
               
                             JERRY
               So you go in the bathroom at eleven 
               your in bed by what two?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, 
               I gotta another call.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hello?

               
                             MAN
               Good day Ms Benes, this is Roger Ipswitch.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh hey! How are things doing in accounting?
 
               
               
                             ROGER
               Ms. Benes, I noticed you have been charging 
               quite a bit of merchandise
 
               
               on the Peterman account.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, I am the President.

               
                             ROGER
               Yes, and we're all very impressed. Never 
               the less the expense account
 
               
               is for business purposes only.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, isn't the president allowed to 
               do anything that they want?
 
               
                             ROGER
               No, I'll be in your office first thing 
               tomorrow. Good day.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Good day. (Elaine and Roger hang up, 
               leaving Jerry still on hold)

               Hello, anybody?

               Hey, why didn't you get the big one?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               This hat just bottles in the heat, I 
               don't even need a coat! It's
 
               
               unbelievable!

               
                             JERRY
               I don't believe it.

               
                             GEORGE
               And I got a date with the sales woman. 
               She's got a little Marisa
 
               
               Tomei thing going on.

               
                             JERRY
               Ah, too bad you got a little George 
               Costanza thing going on.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I'm going out with her tomorrow, she 
               said she had some errands to run.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               That's a date?

               
                             GEORGE
               What's the difference? You know they 
               way I work, I'm like a
 
               
               commercial jingle. First it's a little irritating, then you hear
 
               
               
               it a few times, you hum it in the shower, by the third date it's
 
               
               
               "By Mennen!".

               
                             JERRY
               How do you make sure your gonna get 
               to the third date?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind 
               keys, glove, scarf, I go
 
               
               back to her place to pick it up...date number three.

               
                             JERRY
               That's so old. Why don't you show up 
               at her door in a wood horse?
 
               
               (Jerry is at his apartment door)

               
                             JERRY
               "By Mennen"

               
               (Jerry notices a red dot on his door, he traces it to Kramer's 
               peep hole,
 
               
               Jerry then knocks on Kramer's door. When the door is opened a 
               huge red light
 
               
               is seen, Kramer is there smoking away on a cigar)

               
                             JERRY
               What's going on in there?

               
                             KRAMER
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               The light!

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh the red, its the chicken roaster 
               sign, its right across my window.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Can't you shut the shades?

               
                             KRAMER
               They are shut, oh yea your friend Seth 
               stopped by.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yea? What'd he say?

               
                             KRAMER
               he was fired.

               
               (Cut to Elaine's office, Elaine is trying to convince the accounting 
               guy that
 
               
               all of her expenses are business related)

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, as you can see the comforter I 
               expensed is actually the
 
               
               Aristotle goose down tunic. So what do you think?

               
                             ROGER
               Another bulls eye.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of 
               my expenses are obviously for a
 
               
               legitimate business purpose.

               
               ( Elaine turns on water pic to water plants.)

               
                             ROGER
               I just need to see the sable hat you 
               purchased yesterday.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               The hat? Why do you need to see the 
               hat?
 
               
                             ROGER
               Because it costs eight-thousand dollars.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
               (Hits Roger with water from water pic.)

                             JERRY
               Seth, if you knew the meeting was so 
               important why did you go the
 
               
               lunch with me?

               
                             SETH
               We're old college buddies.

               
                             JERRY
               I only knew you through Moochie.

               
                             SETH
               Hey Jerry don't worry about it, the 
               important thing is that we got to
 
               
               
               catch up. Mind if I grab the want ads?

               
                             JERRY
               Actually I haven't read Tank McNamara 
               yet.
 
               
               (Exit Seth. Kramer comes over, hits the wall. )

               How's life on the red planet?

               
                             KRAMER
               Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't 
               sleep, all I can see is that
 
               
               giant red sun in the shape of a chicken.

               
                             JERRY
               Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers 
               and complain?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Ah, they have me the heave ho. I don't 
               think that Kenny Rogers has
 
               
               any idea what's going on down there.

               
               (Kramer gets out a bowl, fills it with cereal and then removes 
               the tomato
 
               
               juice from the fridge.)

               
                             JERRY
               What are you doing?

               
                             KRAMER
               Getting some cereal

               
                             JERRY
               That's tomato juice.

               
               (Kramer takes a big spoonful of cereal w/tomato juice!)

               Rods and Cones are all screwed
 
               
               up! Alright, that's it I gotta move in with you Jerry.

               I don't know Kramer, my only concern 
               is that ....

               start to get on each others

               Alright listen to me, I got a great 
               idea. You're a heavy sleeper,
 
               
               right? Why don't we switch apartments?

               
                             JERRY
               Or I could sleep in the park? You could 
               knock these walls down, make
 
               
               it an eight room luxury suite.

               
                             KRAMER
               Jerry these are lode baring walls, they're 
               not gonna come down!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yea, that's no good.

               
                             KRAMER
               I may have to drive that place out of 
               business.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How you gonna do that?

               
                             KRAMER
               Like we did in the sixties, takin' in 
               to the streets.

               Thanks George, but I got it from here.

               Oh no I'm in already come on.

               
               (George puts down the bags he came in with)

                             WOMAN
               No, I'm gonna be pretty busy.

                             WOMAN
               Hey, you forgot your keys.

               
                             GEORGE
               What, those aren't my keys.

                             HEATHER
               Oy!

               
                             GEORGE
               Ah , listen. I don't mean to bother 
               you but, silly me, I think I may
 
               
               have left my hat in your apartment. So I thought I'd just come 
               by
 
               
               later and pick it up.

               
                             HEATHER
               You didn't' leave a hat here.

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm pretty sure I left it behind the 
               cushion of the chair ...
 
               
               accidentally.

               couldn't be.

               Costanza's. Whether you're aware of it or not George had this
 
               
               
               pathetic little plan to leave something behind so he could weazel

               second date.

               Well not really...

               
                             ELAINE
               George...Anyway I know you told him 
               you didn't have the hat because
 
               
               you didn't want to see him again. And, more sympathetic I could 
               not
 
               
               be. But I really do need to have that hat back.

               Look, I don't know what to tell you, 
               but there's no hat here. I mean,
 
               
               maybe the maid took it, I had people over, but...

               four o'clock they're gonna take me down like Nixon.

               Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. 
               we got to talking, he sells
 
               
               Russian hats down at battery park, forty bucks.

               Yea, but get this, the message said 
               'call me if you have the time'.
 
               
               Heh heh if I have the time, you get it?

               She knows that I have her clock, I know 
               that she has my hat, I think
 
               
               she's getting ready to make an exchange.

               Of course there's the possibility that

               I've looked at that, seems unlikely.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               I'd look again. So, how come you didn't 
               call Jerry about all this?
