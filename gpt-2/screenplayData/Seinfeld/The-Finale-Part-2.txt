               Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Would it kill him to check up on us? 
               No - drops off the meals and that's 
               it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're 
               still entitled to catsup.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I guess we could've called for help.

               But then we would have missed the whole 
               thing.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I still had it on video. We could have 
               watched it later.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, he's right.

               
                             JERRY
               I forgot about the video.

               
                             ELAINE
               Sure - the video.

               Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight 
               we'll be talking about what most of 
               you have probably been
 
               
               discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your 
               offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan 
               trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now 
               before we meet our distinguished panel, let's go to Latham live, 
               where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane-
 
               
                             WELLS
               Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.

               
                             RIVERA
               What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
 
               
               
                             WELLS
               Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, 
               considering the media circus that has 
               descended upon this quaint little town.
 
               
               
                             RIVERA
               And what about the defendants - the 
               so-called New York Four. How are they 
               holding up?
 
               
                             WELLS
               Well, I did speak with one of the deputies 
               who had some contact with them, and 
               he told me quote "There's no love lost 
               with that group."
 
               
                             RIVERA
               Anything else, Jane?

               
                             WELLS
               There also seems to be some friction 
               between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. 
               The rumor is that they once dated,
 
               
               
               and it's possible that ended badly.

               
                             RIVERA
               Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, 
               maybe this trial will bring them closer 
               together. Maybe they'll even end up 
               getting married.

               could last for weeks.

                             MORTY
               You got enough here for a life sentence.

               more that anything.

               Poor Georgie, was it our fault this

               This is excellent huh? Don't worry I 
               didn't use too much milk, cause I know 
               we gotta make it last.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You know I've had to reduce my milk 
               level. My whole life I've always filled 
               to at least three quarters - sometimes, 
               to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, 
               I can't even see the milk anymore. It's 
               a big adjustment.
 
               
                             KRAMER

               trying to give you amoral compass. You 
               have no moral compass. You're going 
               to walk into that courtroom, and the 
               jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil 
               George Costanza. I want them to see 
               Perry Como. No one's going to convict 
               Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat

               acting a fool, you gonna find yourself 
               in here for a long, long time. I don't

               Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our 
               City Council by a vote of twelve to 
               two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, 
               essentially, we made it a crime to ignore 
               a fellow human being in trouble. Now 
               this group from New York not only ignored, 
               but, as we will prove, they actually 
               mocked the victim as he was being robbed 
               at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one 
               other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this 
               is not the first time they have behaved 
               in this manner. On the contrary, they 
               have quite a record of mocking and maligning. 
               This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, 
               immaturity, and greed. And you will 
               see how everyone who has come into contact 
               with these four individuals has been 
               abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. 
               This time, they have gone too far. This 
               time they are going to be held accountable.

               I am shocked and chagrined, mortified 
               and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! 
               It is a waste of the taxpayers' time 
               and money. It is a travesty of justice 
               that these four people have been incarcerated 
               while the real perpetrator is walking 
               around laughing - lying and laughing, 
               laughing and lying. You know what these 
               four people were? They were innocentbystanders. 
               Now, you just think about that term. 
               Innocent. Bystanders. Because that's 
               exactly what they were. We know theywere 
               bystanders, nobody's disputing that. 
               So how can a bystander be guilty? No 
               such thing. Have you ever heard of a 
               guilty bystander? No, because you cannot 
               be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders 
               are by definition, innocent. That is 
               the nature of bystanding. But no, they 
               want to change nature here. They want 
               to create a whole new animal - the guilty 
               bystander. Don't you let them do it. 
               Only you can stop them.

               And I never got my immigration renewal 
               papers. So they deported me. It's all 
               his fault. Him. And the woman. But they 
               did not care. They're totally indifferent. 
               All they do is mock me, just like they 
               did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, 
               mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking. 
               All the time! Now it is Babu's turn 
               to mock. Finally I will have some justice. 
               Send them away! Send them all away! 
               Lock them up forever! They are not human.

               Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and 
               welcome to this special edition of Rivera 
               Live. Well, arguments in the
 
               
               Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation 
               for four and a half hours now. Let's go live to

                             WELLS
               Yes, it's a very incriminating piece 
               of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, 
               this courtroom and everyone who has 
               attended this trial is still reeling 
               from the endless parade of witness who 
               have come forth so enthusiastically 
               to testify against these four seemingly 
               ordinary people. One even had the feeling 
               that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally 
               put a stop to it, it could've gone on 
               for months.

               most strongly with this jury?

               the doctor with the poison invitations. 
               The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic 
               and tragic figure. And that bizarre 
               contest certainly didn't sit well with 
               this small town jury.There's the woman 
               they sold the defective wheelchair to, 
               the deported Pakistani restaurateur. 
               Geraldo, it just went on,
 
               
               and on, and on, into the night.

                             JERRY
               Maybe because she knows you're going 
               to jail.

                             VANDELAY
               Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have 
               you reached a verdict?
 
               
                             FOREMAN
               We have, Your Honor.

               
                             VANDELAY
               Will the defendants please rise. And 
               how do you find, with respect to the 
               charge of criminal indifference?
 
               
                             FOREMAN
               We find the defendants - guilty.

               
                             VANDELAY
               Order! Order in this court, I will clear 
               this room! I do not know how, or under 
               what circumstances the four of you found 
               each other, but your callous indifference 
               and utter disregard for everything that 
               is good and decent has rocked the very 
               foundation upon which our society is 
               built. I can think of nothing more fitting 
               than for the four of youto spend a year 
               removed from society so that you can 
               contemplate the manner in which you 
               have conducted yourselves.
 
               
               I know I will. This court is adjourned.

               We gotta get out of here. We want to

               What?

               
                             CHILES
               Oh, and by the way, they're real, and 
               they're spectacular.

               Well, it's only a year. That's not so 
               bad. We'll be out in a year, and then 
               we'll be back
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Could be fun. Don't have to worry about 
               your meals, or what you're going to 
               do Saturday night. And they do shows. 
               Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe 
               "Bye Bye Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". 
               Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.

               Why don't you just blow it out your...

                             ELAINE
               If I call Jill from prison, do you think 
               that would make up for the other ones?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Sure.

               
                             ELAINE
               Cause you only get one call. The prison 
               call is like the king of calls.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I think that would be a very nice gesture.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               I got it - it's out! How about that, 
               huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.
 
               
                             JERRY
               See now, to me, that button is in the 
               worst possible spot.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Really?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh yeah. The second button is the key 
               button. It literally makes or breaks 
               the shirt. Look at it, it's
 
               
               too high, it's in no-man's land.

               Haven't we had this conversation before?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You think?

               
                             GEORGE
               I think we have.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, maybe we have.

               So what is the deal with the yard? I 
               mean when I was a kid my mother wanted 
               me to play in the yard. But of
 
               
               course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy 
               sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why 
               do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we 
               have to be sent to prison, in prison?
 
               
               You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, 
               anyone from Cellblock D?
 
               
                             PRISONER 1

                             JERRY
               I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love 
               Cellblock D. My friend George is in 
               Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?

               Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. 
               Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding 
               sir - lighten up. How about
 
               
               you, what are you in for?

               Hey, I don't come down to where you
