               (Jerry's Apartment)

               
               (Morty and Jerry are sitting at his table; Kramer is standing 
               next to Morty; Helen is getting the fold out sofa ready to sleep)
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               So how'd you come up with the idea for 
               the belt-less trench coat?
 
               
                             MORTY
               I came home one night, and I tripped 
               over one of Jerry's toys. (Jerry smiling 
               points to himself and nods with cards 
               in his hands) So I took out my belt 
               just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse 
               of myself in the mirror.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               How serendipitous.

               
                             MORTY
               So that night I cut off the loops and 
               the Executive was born.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Mmm

               
                             JERRY
               He also came up with an idea for a brimless 
               rain-hat but that never materialized. 
               (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Did you call Jack Klompus yet?

               
                             MORTY
               I haven't been able to reach him. Hey 
               I'll call him right now.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Ah come on.

               
                             MORTY
               Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               No I haven't seen it yet.

               
                             HELEN
               Oh you have to go you have to

               
                             JERRY
               I'm going

               
                             HELEN
               You have to

               
                             JERRY
               Ok

               
                             MORTY
               (on the phone) Hello Jack.

               
               (Jack in Florida)

               
                             JACK
               Ya

               
                             MORTY
               It's Morty

               
                             JACK
               Who died?

               
                             MORTY
               Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me 
               a big favor. (Jerry holding up some 
               cards looking at his father) In my garage 
               there are a couple of boxes.
 
               
                             JACK
               What boxes?

               
                             MORTY
               I'm gonna explain what boxes.

               
                             JACK
               Alright how the hell do I know?

               
                             MORTY
               Anyway there are these three big boxes, 
               you can't miss them. I want you to ship 
               them here to New York for me.
 
               
                             JACK
               I thought you're going to Paris

               
                             MORTY
               I'm still going to Paris. I got a big 
               deal cooking here.
 
               
                             JACK
               What's in the boxes?

               
                             MORTY
               Raincoats.

               
                             JACK
               Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're 
               gonna sell those old crappy raincoats? 
               That's garbage.
 
               
                             HELEN
               I guarantee you Doris is not letting 
               him mail those boxes.
 
               
                             JACK
               When do you want these?

               
                             MORTY
               Send them tomorrow.

               (George, Estelle and Frank are sitting at the table for breakfast 
               all still in what they slept in)
 
               
                             ESTELLE
               You think they're coming tonight?

               
                             GEORGE
               I dunno they said maybe.

               
                             FRANK
               Of course they're coming, they're leaving 
               soon. If they don't come tonight they 
               might not see us.
 
               
                             ESTELLE
               Well they better come, I got all this 
               Paella.
 
               
                             FRANK
               I admire Morty and Helen going to France. 
               We should take a trip, maybe a cruise.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the 
               two of you.
 
               
                             ESTELLE
               Georgie what were you doing poking around 
               the attic last night?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I-I wasn't in the attic.

               
                             ESTELLE
               I heard noise.

               
                             GEORGE
               Maybe it was a mouse.

               
                             FRANK
               (jumping to his feet) OK that's it! 
               We're moving!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What?

               
                             FRANK
               I will not tolerate infestation.

               
                             GEORGE
               You haven't even seen one.

               
                             FRANK
               Don't you understand the very thought, 
               the very idea, I'll never be comfortable 
               again.
 
               
               
               
                             ESTELLE
               All right Frank that's enough.

               
               (Frank sits back down)

               (Rudy is checking out the clothes)

               
                             GEORGE
               I guess I've been hanging on to them 
               for so long cuz i couldn't accept the 
               fact that Dad was really gone forever 
               (hugs a piece of clothing)
 
               
                             RUDY
               Uh huh.

               
                             GEORGE
               They will get a good home won't they?
 
               
               
                             RUDY
               Look I gotta be honest with you there's 
               nothing here too spectacular.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh I beg to differ. My father took great 
               pride in his appearance, he was a very 
               handsome man, a Casanova really.
 
               
                             RUDY
               I'll give you uh two-hundred dollars 
               for the three boxes.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Could you make it two-twenty-five that 
               was his hi-game in bowling.
 
               
                             RUDY
               Yea I'm in a good mood here.

               
                             GEORGE
               Thank you.

               Hey, George what are you doing here?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Uh, I'm just selling some of Dad's things, 
               (looking into Kramer's eyes) that's 
               what he would have wanted.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, I gotcha (clicks)

               
                             GEORGE
               (leaving) That'll do.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh hey guess what. Morty Seinfeld and 
               I are going into business together, 
               selling raincoats.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey that's swell.

               
                             KRAMER
               Yea we worked it out all over dinner 
               last night.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Dinner? (grabs Kramer)

               
                             KRAMER
               Ya.

               
                             GEORGE
               You had dinner with the Seinfelds?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Yea, last night.

               
                             GEORGE
               Was this something you had planned for 
               a while?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               No it was a spur of the moment. Well 
               you know Morty likes to fly by the seat 
               of his vintage pants.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (hurriedly leaves Rudy's) They had plans, 
               They had plans!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Oooo, boy I've never seen these before 
               (looking at the clothes George just 
               sold Rudy)
 
               
                             RUDY
               Well they just came in, part of my spring-time 
               cruise collection. Two for twenty-five 
               dollars.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh I'll take these.

               
                             RUDY
               All right

               
                             KRAMER
               Hey, remember this raincoat that you 
               sold me?
 
               
                             RUDY
               Sure that's the Executive.

               
                             KRAMER
               Ya, you have any others?

               
                             RUDY
               I wish. They don't make 'em anymore.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Suppose I told you I had fifty in mint 
               condition, would you be interested?
 
               
               
                             RUDY
               Very interested

               
                             KRAMER
               Cuz they're coming in from Florida as 
               we speak.
 
               
                             RUDY
               Well bring 'em in.

               
                             KRAMER
               So you'll buy them?

               
                             RUDY
               I don't see what would possibly stop 
               me.

                             GEORGE
               Aaaa (looking around for Jerry) aaaa 
               (finds Jerry) Ah ha. They had plans 
               huh? They were busy. They were busy 
               with their (doing a little dance to 
               make the plans seem all that important) 
               big plans!
 
               
                             JERRY
               What are you talking about?

               
                             GEORGE
               Mom and Pop Seinfeld

               
                             JERRY
               Look I don't know.

               
                             GEORGE
               All right I happen to know what they 
               did last night, they had dinner with 
               Kramer.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh they were tired it was a last minute 
               thing.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               So what's the deal they don't want to 
               have dinner with my parents?
 
               
                             JERRY
               That's right.

               
                             GEORGE
               Is there something wrong with my parents?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Absolutely

               
                             GEORGE
               Because my parents happen to be two 
               pretty wonderful people.
 
               
                             JERRY
               These the people you currently live 
               with?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Yes.

               
                             JERRY
               Uh huh

               
                             GEORGE
               So are they coming tonight or not?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Look I really don't know what they're 
               plans are.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Ok, fine. It's going to be very interesting, 
               very interesting if they don't show 
               up tonight. You know my mother made 
               all this Paella.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What is that anyway?

               
                             GEORGE
               It's a Spanish dish. It's a mélange 
               of fish, an meat with rice. Very tasty.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I-I'll tell 'em

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey could you do one other thing for 
               me?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Name it.

               
                             GEORGE
               You think your parents would have any 
               objections to taking a little kid to 
               Paris with them? (Jerry looks at him 
               confused) It turns out that the kid's 
               father lives in Paris. (chuckling) Is 
               that a coincidence? (Jerry smiles) Eh 
               you know Alec wants me to take him over 
               there so I figure as long as they're 
               going (claps)
 
               
                             JERRY
               So you thought as long as they're mailing 
               postcards, it wouldn't be too much to 
               ask my parents to drag a child who they've 
               never seen, through the streets of Paris?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (pause) All right if you think it's 
               too much they don't have to mail the 
               postcards.
 
               
               
               
               (Elaine's Office)

               
               (Elaine at her desk; Joanna standing near the door)

               
                             JOANNE
               So where's he taking you?

               
                             ELAINE
               Well first we're going to a matinee, 
               I'm taking the afternoon off, we're 
               gonna go see "My Fair Lady" and they 
               we are gonna go to dinner. He knows 
               all these fantastic places.
 
               
                             JOANNE
               You are one lucky girl. (Elaine laughs 
               in happiness) Wish I could find a nice 
               guy. (Joanne goes to leave; Aaron enters) 
               Hi Aaron.
 
               
                             AARON
               (getting up in Aaron's face) Hey Joanne. 
               (turns to Elaine and goes over to her) 
               Hey
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (already out from behind her desk goes 
               to Aaron) Hi
 
               
               (Elaine and Aaron kiss)

               
               (Enter Helen)

               
                             HELEN
               Hello, Hello.

               
               (Enter Morty)

               
                             MORTY
               Hello Elaine

               
               (Morty gives Elaine a kiss; Elaine is in shock)

               
                             AARON
               I was able to finagle two more tickets 
               to "My Fair Lady" and I thought why 
               not ask Morty and Helen.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, Great.

               
                             MORTY
               (looking around) This is some office. 
               What's the square footage?
 
               
                             HELEN
               You don't mind to you Elaine?

               
                             ELAINE
               Mind? Oh o-of course not.

               
                             AARON
               We can make a whole day of it.

               
                             MORTY
               This is some building, Harry Fleming 
               used to have an office here. There was 
               a deli on the first floor. You don't 
               get corned beef like that anymore. What 
               happened to that deli?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (somewhat annoyed) I really don't know 
               Mr. Seinfeld
 
               
               
               
               (Collection of Scenes with the music and singing from "My Fair 
               Lady" over them. First the matinée where we see (from left to 
               right) Helen, Morty, Elaine and Aaron. Morty opens a candy bar 
               takes a bite then offers it to Elaine then Aaron who takes it 
               as the scene changes to the Cafe 123. At the restaurant we see 
               (from left to right) Morty, Elaine, Helen and Aaron. Morty is 
               pointing at a painting while talking to Elaine then takes off 
               his glasses. Next George is seen getting ready to hop into a 
               cab when Morty, Elaine, Aaron and Helen ride by in a horse drawn 
               carriage (Handsome Cab) drinking champagne. George then smacks 
               the top of the cab in disgust)
 
               (song from "My Fair Lady") "I could have danced all night, I 
               could have danced all night, and still have begged for more. 
               I could have spread my wings, and done a thousand things, I've 
               never done before. I never know what made it so exciting, but 
               all at once my heart would fly"

               (stopping them) We better not. (they 
               make out some more; then stop) T-They're 
               gonna be here any second.

               When are they leaving?

               
                             JERRY
               In two days.

               (from outside the door; singing) I could 
               have danced all night (entering with 
               Helen) I could have danced all night 
               and still have

               You know I still got that pen, the one 
               that writes upside down.

                             JACK
               Morty, listen I can't get into the garage.
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               What do you mean?

               
                             JACK
               There is something wrong with the key. 
               The key doesn't work
 
               
                             MORTY
               You gotta jiggle it a little bit. I 
               jiggled it. I jiggled it for fifteen 
               minutes.

               Tell him to come down here and get his 
               own packages. You have nothing better 
               to do then worry about his boxes.
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               You gotta pull on the knob as you turn 
               it.
 
               
                             JACK
               Get the hell outta here with your knob.
 
               
               
                             DORIS
               What does he want from you?

               
                             MORTY
               My idiot son could open that garage 
               door.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What did I do?

               
                             MORTY
               Just do it first thing tomorrow. I need 
               it.

                             MORTY
               They'll be here first thing Thursday 
               morning.
 
               
                             HELEN
               Thursday morning? You know we're leaving 
               at three o'clock.
 
               
                             JERRY
               (in a hurry) Yea you're leaving at three 
               o'clock.
 
               
                             HELEN
               How are you gonna get all this done 
               in time?
 
               
                             MORTY
               Don't worry about it.

               
                             JERRY
               (in a hurry) Ya how you gonna get all

               Yea

               
                             FRANK
               It's a slap in the face.

               
                             ESTELLE
               (with her arms out in wonder) What did 
               we ever do to them? (George puts his 
               arms out and imitates Estelle as she 
               moves her arms up and down as she speaks) 
               I want to know what we did them!
 
               
                             FRANK
               What are they too good for us? A raincoat 
               salesman, I could buy and sell 'em like 
               that.

               bothers me the most, is the lying.

               those clothes for years.

               How can I go on a cruise with out my 
               cabana wear? I love those, those clothes. 
               (Looks down yells) AH! (jumps out of 
               his chair) A mouse! I saw a mouse! (takes 
               off into another room with glass doors

               I-I-I'm not crazy about used clothes. I mean they call it vintage, 
               you know to take your mind off of what it really is 'nasty wear.' 
               Oh it's clean you know people wear underwear, ya well they don't 
               wear iron underwear and that's what it's gonna take to get me 
               in those clothes. I mean I'll move into an apartment after a 
               strange person moves out, why would I wanna move into somebody's 
               pants? There is no vintage underwear of course, but it's not 
               because the guy couldn't sell his underwear, it's because men 
               wear their underwear until it absolutely disintegrates. Men hang 
               on to underwear until, until each individual underwear molecule 
               is so strained it can barely retain the properties of a solid. 
               It actually becomes underwear vapor. W-we don't even throw it 
               out, we just open a window and it goes out like dandelion spoors. 
               That's how men throw out underwear we just go (blows on the mic) 
               and it's gone that it is jus.

               So Klompus has the key, but the jerk 
               couldn't open it up. All you gotta do 
               it jiggle it (has is hand out jiggling) 
               jus get it in there (jiggling making 
               a bunch of noises) jigg jigg jiggle

                             GEORGE
               I'm trying to buy some of the clothes 
               back. (realizing something) Hey you 
               wanna come over for dinner tonight? 
               My mother made all this extra Paella.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Payaya, ya I'll be there.

               
                             GEORGE
               Apparently the Seinfelds' are too good 
               for us. I shouldn't say anything bad 
               about your uh your partner.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               No no you know we're not partners. I 
               only get twenty-five percent.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Twenty-five percent? It was your idea.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Yap I know.

               
                             GEORGE
               You're doing all the leg work.

               
                             KRAMER
               That's right

               
                             GEORGE
               He's ripping you off

               
                             KRAMER
               You're right he's ripping me off

               
                             GEORGE
               If anybody should be getting more it's 
               you.

                             GEORGE
               Well don't let him take advantage of 
               you like that.

                             MORTY
               You know I've been thinking, why is 
               Kramer getting twenty-five percent?
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               Well he told you about the place.

               
                             MORTY
               So what, why is that worth twenty-five 
               percent? It's a finders fee. You know 
               what a finders fee is?
 
               
                             HELEN
               You find something you get a fee.

               
                             MORTY
               Finder's fee is ten percent and no more.
 
               
               
                             HELEN
               Well it's too late now.

               
                             MORTY
               Those are my coats. I saved them, I 
               stored them, I've been waiting years 
               for this pay off.
 
               
                             HELEN
               Well you're not gonna say anything.

                             KRAMER
               Ahh! I don't think the deal is fair.
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               You don't think it's fair.

               
                             KRAMER
               No no, I found the place, I set the 
               whole thing up, I'm doing all the leg 
               work.
 
               
                             MORTY
               What leg work?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, there's leg work.

               
                             MORTY
               If anything you're getting too much.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Too much?!

               
                             MORTY
               That's right, they're my coats.

               
                             KRAMER
               Look I want thirty-five percent.

               
                             MORTY
               I'm thinking more like fifteen.

               
                             KRAMER
               No way I'm taking fifteen.

               
                             MORTY
               Well you're not getting thirty-five.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Alright let's compromise. Twenty-five 
               percent.

               Moths are a discourage to my business, 
               all it takes is one moth to lay eggs. 
               You know what happens to the larvae? 
               They hatch and they're everywhere.

               N-I know they're your parents Jerry 
               an' they're very nice people. But don't 
               you think it's odd, that a thirty-five 
               year old man is going to these lengths 
               to see that someone else's parents are 
               enjoying themselves? I mean don't you 
               find that abnormal?

               It is a tad askew.

               I mean they're your parents and you 
               don't do anything. So why is this stranger 
               doing it?

               See, See, I can't even say anything 
               you know because all he's really doing

               You're right he's insane.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yes, he's insane, that's what I think.

               out during Schindler's List?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone 
               in a long time, it just got the better

                             HELEN
               Wondering what?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Why I didn't see you at Schindler's 
               List with Jerry.
 
               
                             HELEN
               Well we already saw it.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Oh, well it's a good thing for Jerry 
               that you didn't go.
 
               
                             MORTY
               (getting up from the table and coming 
               over) Why is that?
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Well he really seemed to have his hands 
               full if you know what I mean.
 
               
                             HELEN
               I'm afraid I don't.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Him and his little buxom friend Rachel 
               were going at it pretty good in the 
               balcony.
 
               
                             MORTY
               What?

               
                             NEWMAN
               What, do I have to spell it out for 
               ya? He was moving on her like the storm-troopers 
               into Poland.
 
               
                             HELEN
               Jerry was necking during Schindler's 
               List?
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               Yes! A more offensive spectacle I cannot 
               recall. Anyway I just really came up 
               to get some detergent.
 
               
                             HELEN
               Jerry sends his laundry out.

               
                             NEWMAN
               (laughing) Oh ho right. Well very nice 
               seeing you folks and a by the way you 
               didn't hear this from me. Tata (runs 
               down the hallway laughing)
 
               
               (Helen closes the door and looks at Morty in disgust)

               
               
               
               (Jerry's Apartment-Later that day)

               
               (Jerry enters; Morty is sitting on the couch writing, Helen is 
               in the bathroom)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hi (takes off his coat and puts it on 
               the counter at which point his parents 
               are both right by him as he goes into 
               the refrigerator. He grabs a drink then 
               turns around to see his parents right 
               there) What? What did I do?
 
               
                             HELEN
               How could you?

               
                             JERRY
               How could I what?

               
                             HELEN
               You were making out during Schindler's 
               List?
 
               
                             JERRY
               What? No.

               
                             MORTY
               Don't lie Jerry.

               
                             JERRY
               (turns) Newman.

               
                             HELEN
               How could you do such a thing?

               
                             JERRY
               I couldn't help it. We hadn't been alone 
               together in a long time and we just 
               kinda started up a little during the 
               coming attractions and the next thing 
               we knew, the war was over.
 
               
               (Morty and Helen both sigh and turn to go back to what they were 
               doing; Phone rings)
 
               
                             JERRY
               (answering the phone) Hello.

               
               (Jack in Florida with a bandage on his right hand)

               
                             JACK
               Hello Jerry, it's Jack Klompus.

               
                             JERRY
               Hang on a second. (handing Morty the 
               phone) Dad it's Klompus.
 
               
                             MORTY
               Hello

               
                             JACK
               Hello Morty, listen that key doesn't 
               work. It's no good.
 
               
                             MORTY
               You didn't get in?

               
                             JACK
               Oh I got in, I had to break the window 
               with a rock and then I got my hand all 
               cut up reaching in.
 
               
                             MORTY
               You broke the window?

               
                             HELEN
               He broke the window?

               
                             JACK
               You wanted those damn boxes didn't you?
 
               
               
                             DORIS
               (off camera) He should be on his hands 
               and knees thanking you.
 
               
                             MORTY
               Did you send them?

               
                             JACK
               Yea, they'll be there tomorrow afternoon, 
               two o'clock.
 
               
                             MORTY
               Tomorrow afternoon?

               
                             HELEN
               Tomorrow afternoon?

               
                             JERRY
               Tomorrow afternoon?

               
                             MORTY
               I told you to send them express.

               
                             JACK
               W-well it was ten dollars cheaper in 
               the afternoon than the morning, I figured 
               what the hell's the difference.
 
               
                             MORTY
               So what did you do about the window?
 
               
               
                             JACK
               I gotta fix your window now?

               
                             MORTY
               All right all right. Goodbye. (Morty 
               hangs up the phone, Jack hangs up the 
               phone) I don't think we are gonna make 
               that flight.
 
               
                             JERRY
               W-what do you mean you're not making 
               the flight?
 
               
                             HELEN
               We have to make the flight, we're with 
               a charter group. If we don't the trip 
               is off.
 
               
                             MORTY
               Well what's the difference we'll go 
               some place else.
 
               
               (Jerry annoyed walks toward his room)

               
                             HELEN
               Some place else? What about Paris?
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               You don't understand, I've come this 
               far, I can't stop now.
 
               
                             HELEN
               I can't believe that you're doing all 
               this just to sell some stupid raincoats.
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               You don't understand fashion is cyclical 
               this thing could come back.
 
               
                             HELEN
               I think you're out of your mind.

                             FRANK
               I just don't understand how all those 
               clothes can disappear.

                             KRAMER
               Well Rudy's the guy buying Morty's raincoats.
 
               
               
                             FRANK
               Mory Seinfeld? He's a bum.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, the whole deal going down tomorrow. 
               Morty's gonna miss his plane for it.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Missing his plane? Wasn't that a charter 
               flight?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yea.

               
                             GEORGE
               What happens to charter tickets when 
               you don't use em?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Well I suppose they are wasted.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes I suppose they are.

               
                             FRANK
               Tomorrow I'm going straight down to 
               this Rudy and get my clothes.

               (Frank starts making noises; Kramer and Frank both run to the 
               other room where they get stuff in between the door and wall; 
               Frank hits Kramer to get him in then closes the door)

               You want the tickets?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yes.

               Hey I get a free trip to Paris, I go 
               in the Big Brother's Hall-of-Fame, I 
               mail my own postcards.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You know I'm paying for these tickets.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               It's alright, I got lunch.

               Oh, you should have gone to the Costanzas' 
               for dinner. Mmm the Payaya was magnificent. 
               Have you ever had really good Paella?
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               Not really.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh it's a orgiastic feast for the senses. 
               The want and the festival, the sites, 
               sounds, and colors an mmmummumm mumm
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Hey Dad are you sure we are at the right 
               carousel?
 
               
                             MORTY
               This is it.

               
                             KRAMER
               So how much are we gonna make?

               
                             MORTY
               Take it easy, I've been through a million 
               of these negotiations.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Wha two thousand? Three thousand?

               
                             MORTY
               That's giving it away. This is a one 
               of a kind item.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               More? More than three thousand?

               
                             MORTY
               Just watch me do my thing.

               
                             JERRY
               Say Dad, (pointing at a raincoat sitting 
               on the carousel next to an open box) 
               isn't that one of yours?
 
               
                             MORTY
               Look at this. Look at how this idiot 
               packed it. He didn't tape it, he just 
               flipped the flaps. (Kramer, Morty and 
               Jerry are looking around grabbing raincoats 
               which are scattered all over the place.) 
               Kramer you missed a couple.

               (turns around noticing the Charter flight) 
               Dad isn't that your charter group?

               Honesty, hard-work, these are the values 
               that I was raised on. The most important 
               thing Joey, is to be able to look yourself 
               in the mirror before you go to sleep 
               at night.
 
               
                             JOEY
               Hey! I got news for you four eyes, there's 
               no way you're staying with us in Paris.

               the wall.)

               You burned them? Those clothes are not 
               yours to burn.
 
               
                             RUDY
               Who are you anyways?

               
                             FRANK
               I'm the father.

               
                             RUDY
               He said his father was dead.

               
                             FRANK
               He said I was dead?

               
                             RUDY
               That's right. Squeezed an extra twenty-five 
               dollars out of me.
 
               
                             FRANK
               That's what my life is worth to him? 
               Twenty-five dollars.

                             FRANK
               Oh, I just want to you know I'm retracting 
               our dinner invitation.
 
               
                             MORTY
               Well you don't have to retract it because 
               we never went.
 
               
                             FRANK
               I'm retracting that it was ever offered.
 
               
               
                             MORTY
               I retract your retraction.

               junk of yours?

               business here.
 
               
                             RUDY
               You can keep your raincoats. I'm not 
               interested.

               Who's off the street? I'm in the raincoat 
               business for thirty-five years.
 
               
                             RUDY
               Ya how do I know there aren't moths 
               like his stuff?

               Because of his moths you're not buying 
               my raincoats?

               Make sure Kramer uses good tape when 
               he sends back the raincoats.

                             ELAINE
               Aaron? Aaron are you ok?

               
                             AARON
               I could've done more. I could've done 
               so much more.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You did enough.

               
                             AARON
               (turning toward her) No, I could've 
               called the travel agency, got them on 
               another flight to Paris, I coulda got 
               them out.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You tried Aaron, it was too expensive.
 
               
               
                             AARON
               (holds his arm up) This watch, this 
               watch could've paid for their whole 
               trip. (holds his other hand up) This 
               ring, this ring is one more dinner I 
               could've taken them out to. (Jerry and 
               Elaine look at each other like he's 
               crazy) Water, they need some water (turns 
               around and runs to the Flight Agent)
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Why?

               
                             AARON
               (to the Flight Agent) They'll get dehydrated 
               on the plane! Get the Seinfelds some 
               water. Please! Please!
 
               
               (Jerry and Elaine continue to look at him funny)

               
               
               
               (Rachel's Parents' Place)

               
               (Jerry knocks on the door; Mr. Goldstein answers)

               
                             JERRY
               Hi Mr. Goldstein is Rachel home?

               
                             MR. GOLDSTEIN
               I'm afraid Rachel's not going to be 
               able to see you tonight, or any other 
               night for that matter.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Why what did I do?

               
                             MR. GOLDSTEIN
               (Rachel is know seen behind her Dad) 
               You know very well. I heard about your 
               behavior at the movies the other night 
               it was disgraceful. You should be ashamed 
               of yourself, I for one will not allow 
               my daughter to be involved with someone 
               of such weak moral fiber. Fortunately 
               my postman happened to have witnessed 
               the entire incident. A heavy set fellow, 
               I believe he lives in your building. 
               (Jerry turns to almost do a 'Newman') 
               Now if you don't mind. (starts to close 
               the door)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Rachel!

               
                             MR. GOLDSTEIN
               (closing the door on Jerry) Good night!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Rachel!

               
               
               
               (Monk's)

               
               (Jerry and Elaine at the normal booth)

               
                             JERRY
               So my parents get home, they open the 
               door, my father flicks the light on, 
               the whole place is cleaned out, everything.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Aahh, (pushes Jerry from her seat at 
               the table) Get Out! How did it happen?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               The broken window, Klompus never fixed 
               it. They just walked right in.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oohh, boy. They could use a vacation.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yea they're taking one, the travel agent 
               is trying to set something else up for 
               them.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (sighs) So how about that Aaron?

               
                             JERRY
               Whew

               
                             ELAINE
               You know what drove me crazy about him? 
               Did you ever notice that he stood too 
               close to you when he talked?
 
               
                             JERRY
               No I hadn't noticed.

               
               (Newman enters and walks by the table; Jerry doesn't notice him 
               as he is getting something out of his coat pocket)
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               (at the counter) Pair of bear claws 
               please.
 
               
                             JERRY
               (hearing Newman turns and sees him) 
               Hiya Newman.
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               (moving away from the counter getting 
               closer to the door) Hello Jerry.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Say, I happened to catch you coming 
               out of Schindler's List the other night.
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               Ohh, were you there?

               
                             JERRY
               Yes I was.

               
                             NEWMAN
               (looking scared) I-it's a it's a...powerful 
               film.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yes, shocking brutality don't you think?
 
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               (couple quick breaths) Shocking.

               
                             JERRY
               Yes, well that was nothing.

               
               (Newman makes a noise and takes off toward the door as Jerry 
               gets up)
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               (running out the door) Jerry! Jerry!

               Where the hell is your father?!

               Joey puts some stuff on George's glasses)

               I just hope those exterminators know 
               what they're doing.
 
               
                             ESTELLE
               Ah forget about them let's just...

               Personal distance is a very important thing. There's a new personal 
               distance, ATM distance. When someone's using an ATM, you wanna 
               be about six feet back don't you? Because people a little edgy 
               around that ATM don't they? They got their money out, their eyes 
               are darting all around. The other place I wanna be about six 
               feet away is Urinals, you want some distance there too. ATMs 
               and Urinals, I guess whenever someone's taking valuable out of 
               their pants you want to give them as much room as possible.
 
               
               
               
                                THE END
