               (Jerry's apartment, Jerry is at the table and Elaine is on the 
               phone)
 
               
               
               
                             ELAINE
               (to the phone) Well did he bring it 
               up in the meeting?
 
               
               
               
               (Jerry picks up a yellow shirt and walks to Elaine)

               
               
               
                             JERRY
               Elaine, see this T-shirts, six years 
               I've had this T-shirts, it's my
 
               
               best one, I call him...Golden Boy

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm on the phone here.

               
                             JERRY
               Golden Boy is always the first shirt 
               I wear out of the laundry, here
 
               
               touch Golden Boy!

               
                             ELAINE
               No thanks. (to the phone)Yeah, Yeah 
               I'll hold.
 
               
                             JERRY
               But see look at the collar, see it's 
               fraying. Golden Boy is slowly
 
               
               dying. Each wash is brings him one step closer, that's what makes
 
               
               
               the T-shirts such a tragic figure.

               
                             ELAINE
               Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak 
               in the sink with some
 
               
               Woolight?

               
                             JERRY
               No!!! The reason he's iron man is because 
               he goes out there and plays
 
               
               every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away
 
               
               
               from him, you break his spirit!

               
               
               
               (Elaine is suddenly excited)

               
               
               
                             ELAINE
               (to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! 
               Oh! this is so fantastic! I'm
 
               
               so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK I'll be in soon! OK, OK, I'm
 
               
               
               coming, yeah, yeah I'm coming, I'm coming! (Elaine jumps up and
 
               
               
               dances around) Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer!

               in a
 
               
               limousine!

               
                             JERRY
               You wanna barrow Golden Boy!

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh! Don't you know what this means, 
               it's like working with Tolstoy!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey ya know what I read the most unbelievable 
               thing about Tolstoy the
 
               
               other day, did you know the original title for "War and Peace" 
               was
 
               
               "War--What Is It Good For?"!

               
                             ELAINE
               Ha ha.

               
                             JERRY
               No, no.. I'm not kidding Elaine it's 
               true, his mistress didn't like
 
               
               the title and insisted him change it to "War and Peace"!

               
                             ELAINE
               But it's a line from that song!

               
                             JERRY
               That's were they got it from!

               
                             ELAINE
               Really?

               
                             JERRY
               I'm not joking!

               the mail and starts flipping
 
               
               through)

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, I grabbed it on my way, I don't 
               want my mother reading it.

                             GEORGE
               She'll open!

               
                             JERRY

               What did she say?

               
                             GEORGE
               I was curious!

               
                             JERRY
               Isn't that against the law?

               
                             GEORGE
               Maybe I can get her locked up.

               Ah, maybe you could use this (he searches 
               through his jacket) Ah,

               I'm such a Huge whale fan. These marine 
               biologists were showing how
 
               
               they communicate with each other with these squeaks and squeals, 
               what
 
               
               a fish!

               Well he's kind of modest.

               He was always such a goof-off. I mean

               Yeah...he specializing in whales. He's 
               working on lowering the
 
               
               cholesterol level in whales...all that blubber-- quite unhealthy.
 
               
               
               You know its the largest mammal on earth but as George says "they

               Something huh?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah! How'd she look.

               
                             JERRY
               She looked great. She asked about you.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE

                             JERRY
               "How's George?"

               
                             GEORGE
               George! She said George? She remembered 
               my name. Diane DeConn
 
               
               remembered my name. She was the "it" girl!

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah she asked for your number, I think 
               she's gonna get in touch with
 
               
               you.

               
                             GEORGE
               OK, I'm tellin' you right now if your 
               kiddin' around I'm not gonna
 
               
               be able to be friends with you anymore. I'm serious about that. 
               You
 
               
               got that.

               
                             JERRY
               I got no problem with that.

               
                             GEORGE
               Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this 
               is a joke, if this is your
 
               
               idea of some cute little game...we're finished!

               
                             JERRY
               Expect a call.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh my god he's not kidding.

               
                             JERRY
               Now I should tell you at this point 
               she's under the impression the
 
               
               you are a.....

                             JERRY
               A marine biologist.

               
                             GEORGE
               A marine biologist....why am I a marine 
               biologist?
 
               
                             JERRY
               I may have mentioned it.

               
                             GEORGE
               But I'm not a marine biologist!

               
                             JERRY
               I'm aware of that.

               
                             GEORGE
               So?

               
                             JERRY
               You don't think it's a good job.

               
                             GEORGE
               I didn't think it was a job.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh. It's a fascinating field!

               You know Tolstoy use to write in the

               inspired him.

               Yes. Mr. Lippman. It was his mistress 
               who insisted he called it

                             JERRY
               You know with all do respect I would 
               think it's right up your alley.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Well it's not up my alley! It's one 
               thing if I make it up. I know
 
               
               what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos 
               Islands
 
               
               livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.

               
                             JERRY
               Well you came in the other day with 
               all that whale stuff, the
 
               
               squeaking and the squealing.

               
                             GEORGE
               Why couldn't you have made me an architect? 
               You know I always
 
               
               wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I'm supposed 
               to see
 
               
               her tomorrow, I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. Maybe she likes
 
               
               
               me for me.

               What?

               
                             KRAMER
               I stink! I can't play! The ball is just 
               sitting there, Jerry, and
 
               
               I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way 
               out!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well what happened?

               
                             KRAMER
               I have no concentration!

                             JERRY
               What, what, what's wrong with you?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (Looking 
               down his shirt) Look there
 
               
               is still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand

               me
 
               
               to help track down the owner.

               
                             GEORGE
               How'd she find it?

               
                             JERRY
               It hit her in the head!

               
               
               
               (Woman on the phone and Jerry are sitting in the coffee shop)
 
               
               
               
               
                             CORINNE
               So I am walkin' along, minding my own 
               business when all off the

               Ya.

               
                             CORINNE
               Yeah, So they took me to the hospital 
               and they put me in this thing
 
               
               that fells like a coffin for forty-five minutes. Have you ever 
               been
 
               
               in one of those things? You could go berserk in there!

               
                             JERRY
               Well you have insurance...

               
                             CORINNE

                             CORINNE

               anyway, you can see why I
 
               
               would be interested in finding this person.

               
                             JERRY
               Absolutely. You should not have to pay 
               for that.

               it! Stop it!

                             JERRY
               Typical rich people, using the world 
               for their personal garbage can.
 
               
                             CORINNE
               Boy am I lucky your name came up. I 
               just pushed a button.
 
               
                             JERRY

               doin in this creep's organizer

               me.

               window.

               I transferred everything in there. I 
               threw out my old book. I'm
 
               
               lost now, Kramer.

               Well where is it, give it to me!

               
                             JERRY
               I don't have it!

               
                             ELAINE
               Why not.

               
                             JERRY
               Because she's not returning it until 
               she gets the money back for the
 
               
               hospital bill.

               
                             ELAINE
               But I didn't do Testikov did it, he 
               should have to pay for it!

               How much is Testikov getting from Pendman 
               for this book?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               One million.

               
                             JERRY
               Well that's a start.

               Then of course with evolution the octopus 
               lost the nostrils and took
 
               
               on the more familiar look that we know today. But if you look
 
               
               
               really closely you can still see a bump where the nose use to 
               be.
 
               
                             DIANE

                             GEORGE
               Yeah, but enough about fish I can talk 
               about other things like...
 
               
               architecture...

               Ya, 308. I'm crazy for doing this!

               back don't you?

               to take her out?

               no one asks if he's trying to
 
               
               hit on her!

               
                             ELAINE

               Well you're not Louis Lane.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh. Listen, you have the tape-recorder.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Ya, are you sure you want to do this.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE

               this woman ends up in the
 
               
               "New England Journal Of Medicine" I'm not going to pay for it.

               Yes. That's why I where these sneakers,

               zip, I'm gone.

               (At the beach everyone is yelling at George)

               
               
               
                             CROWD
               Come on! Save the whale! Hurry up it's 
               gonna die!
 
               
                             DIANE
               Save the whale George... for me.

               
               
               
               (He turns and throws his hat down. He walks into the ocean)
 
               
               
               
               
               (At the coffee shop Jerry and Kramer are awaiting the story)
 
               
               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               So I started to walk into the water. 
               I won't lie to you boys, I
 
               
               was terrified! But I pressed on and as I made my way passed the
 
               
               
               breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was 
               divine
 
               
               intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you 
               Jerry
 
               
               at that moment I was a marine biologist!

               
               
               
               (Elaine enters and sits down)

               
               
               
                             ELAINE
               George I was just reading this thing 
               in the papers, it's amazing!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I know I was just telling them the story.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Come on George, finish the story.

               
                             GEORGE
               The sea was angry that day my friends, 
               like an old man trying to
 
               
               return soup at a deli!

               
               
               
               (Jerry gives Kramer a "what the h-" glance)

               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I got about fifty-feet out and then 
               suddenly the great beast
 
               
               appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was 
               a
 
               
               foot. As if sensing my presence he gave out a big bellow. I said,
 
               
               
               "Easy big fella!" And then as I watched him struggling I realized
 
               
               
               something was obstructing his breathing. From where I was standing
 
               
               
               I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!

               
                             JERRY
               Mammal.

               
                             GEORGE
               Whatever.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, what did you do next?

               
                             GEORGE
               Then from out of nowhere a huge title 
               wave lifted, tossed like a cork and 
               I found myself on top of him face to 
               face with the blow-hole. I could barely 
               see from all of the waves crashing down 
               on top of me but I knew something was 
               there so I reached my hand and pulled 
               out the obstruction!
 
               
               
               
               (George pulls out of the inside pocket a golf ball)

               
               
               
               (Jerry and George just stare at Kramer)

               
               
               
                             KRAMER
               What is that a Titleist? A hole in one 
               eh.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well the crowd most have gone wild!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh yes they did Jerry they were all 
               over me. It was like Rocky 1.
 
               
               Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me, and kissed me. 
               We
 
               
               both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so
 
               
               
               beautiful. It was at that moment I decided to tell her I was 
               not a
 
               
               marine biologist!

               
                             JERRY
               Wow! What'd she say?

               
                             GEORGE
               She told me to "Go to hell!" and I took 
               the bus home.
 
               
                             JERRY
               All right lets go.

               
                             ELAINE
               Are you in a bad mood?

               
                             JERRY
               No, I just got my laundry back.

               
                             ELAINE
               Ohhh! GoldenBoy?

               
                             JERRY
               He didn't make it.

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sorry.

               
                             JERRY
               This is GoldenBoy's son, BabyBlue.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               What's with you?

               
                             GEORGE
               Sand. It's everywhere

               
               
               
                            THE END
