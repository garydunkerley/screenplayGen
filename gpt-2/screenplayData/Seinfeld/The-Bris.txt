          ...And so the baby's head comes
          
          out, and I'm screaming and my
          
          brother who's been videotaping
          the
          
          whole thing turns green, his eyes
          
          roll up in his head and he blacks
          
          out, drops the camera, the camera
          
          breaks, then , the placenta comes
          
          flying out.
          

                       ELAINE          
          Whoa.
          

                       STAN          
          And then doctor says...
          

                       JERRY          
          Thank you, that's enough.

          MYRA IS BREAST FEEDING. JERRY WINCES, HE CAN'T WATCH.
          HE IS VISIBLY UNSETTLED.          

                       STAN          
          Will you look at that baby. Sucking
          like there's no tomorrow.
          
          Just sucking away. Suck, suck,
          suck...
          

                       JERRY          
          (LOOKING AWAY) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
          

                       STAN          
          Look at that JERRY, look at that.          
          Sucking, sucking...
          

                       JERRY          
          Yeah, I looked. I saw.
          

                       STAN          
          This doesn't make you uncomfortable,
          does it?
          

                       JERRY          
          Uncomfortable? Not at all. (ASIDE
          TO ELAINE) See your friend's          
          wife's breast sticking out - why
          would that make me          
          uncomfortable?
          

                       STAN          
          Look at him.
          

                       JERRY          
          How long do they do that?
          

                       STAN          
          Oh, a year or two.
          

                       JERRY          
          No break?
          

                       STAN          
          Then comes the weaning.
          

                       JERRY          
          So after the sucking, comes the
          weaning.
          

                       ELAINE          
          First the sucking then the weaning.
          

                       JERRY          
          Well, you gotta wean.
          

                       STAN          
          Gotta wean.
          

                       ELAINE          
          It's a must wean situation.
          

                       PAUSE.          

                       GEORGE          
          What about that spot I got?
          

                       JERRY          
          Yeah, that's a great spot.
          

                       GEORGE          
          You open the door to the car, boom,
          you walk right into the
          
          hospital. You can't beat that spot.
          I'm on a roll. I am just
          
          willing these great parking spots.
          In front of my house. In front
          
          of JERRY's building. Did I tell
          you about the spot in front of
          
          the post office?
          

                       JERRY          
          Yes.
          

                       GEORGE          
          I'm driving to the post office.

                       GEORGE          
          Maybe the baby would like to see
          my spot. A positive, uplifting
          
          message to start his life out with.
          You can still get a great
          
          space in this town - if you apply
          yourself.
          

                       JERRY          
          Where's KRAMER? He should've been
          here by now.
          

                       ELAINE          
          Did you give him the room number?
          

                       JERRY          
          Yes, 1397.

          PATIENT BEHIND A CURTAIN. OUTSIDE          

                       THE CURTAIN IS A TRAY OF FOOD.
          HE PICKS UP THE TRAY. KRAMER IS          

                       HUNGRY AND LIKES HOSPITAL FOOD

                       GEORGE          
          Look at it. I pulled it in perfectly
          equidistant from the car in
          
          front of me and the car behind

          was just lying there and then he
          
          woke up. He looked up at me and
          made this horrible sound (MAKES
          

                       SOUND).

          I'm talking about the pigman, GEORGE.
          I went into the wrong room
          
          and there he was.
          

                       GEORGE          
          A pigman?
          

                       KRAMER

          being a Godparent?

          Yeah.
          

                       KRAMER          
          I would advise against that.
          

                       ELAINE          
          KRAMER. It's a tradition.

          Well, so was sacrificing virgins
          to appease the gods, but we
          
          don't do that anymore.

                       JERRY          
          Maybe they're admiring your spot.
          

                       KRAMER          
          No. They're all looking up.

          A mohel! What the hell is a mohel?
          

                       JERRY          
          A mohel is the person who performs
          the circumcision.
          

                       ELAINE          
          Where am I going to find a Mohel?
          
          (LOOKING THROUGH THE YELLOW PAGES,
          MUTTERING) How do you find a
          
          mohel? Motels, models..
          

                       JERRY          
          Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece
          of cake. Any idiot can find a
          
          Mohel. I have the tough job. I
          have to hold the baby while they
          
          do it. How would you like that
          job?
          

                       ELAINE          
          Have you ever seen one?
          

                       JERRY          
          You mean that wasn't -
          

                       ELAINE          
          Yeah.

          What'd you think?

          (SHAKES HER HEAD) No...
          

                       JERRY          
          Not good?
          

                       ELAINE          
          No, had no face, no personality,
          very dull. It was like a
          
          martian. But hey, that's me.

                       GEORGE          
          Well I just got the estimate. It's
          going to cost more to fix that
          
          roof than the car's worth, So I'm
          gonna go see the hospital
          
          administrator today. Someone's
          paying for that damage and it's
          
          not gonna be me.
          

                       JERRY          
          Ah, you're screwed.
          

                       GEORGE          
          I know, swan dives from twenty
          floors, lands right on to it. What
          
          do I have a bulls eye on there?
          He couldn't move over two feet?
          
          Land on the sidewalk. That's city
          property.
          
          What are the chances, what are
          the odds? He couldn't do it again
          
          if his life depended on it...
          

                       ELAINE          
          Well I have to interview a Mohel.
          

                       JERRY

          Are you alright?
          

                       KRAMER          
          Don't even question my instincts,
          because my instincts are honed.
          
          (RE:PAPER) Look at that.
          

                       JERRY          
          What now?
          

                       HE SHOWS JERRY THE PAPER          

                       JERRY (CONT'D)          
          "Hospital receives grant to conduct
          DNA research".." Government

                       KRAMER          
          Pigman, baby. Pigman.
          

                       ELAINE          
          Oh, if I hear about this pigman
          one more time...
          

                       KRAMER          
          I'm tellin ya the pigman is alive.
          The governments been
          
          experimenting with pigmen since
          the fifties.
          

                       JERRY          
          Will you stop it. Just because
          a hospital gets a grant to study
          
          DNA doesn't mean they are creating
          a race of mutant pigmen.
          

                       KRAMER          
          Oh. JERRY wake up to reality. It's
          military thing. They're
          
          probably creating a whole army
          of pig warriors.
          

                       GEORGE          
          I wish there were pigmen. You get
          a few of these pigmen walking
          
          around I'm looking a whole lot
          better. Then if somebody wants
          to
          
          fix me up at least they could say,
          "Hey he's no pig-man!"
          

                       JERRY          
          Believe me, there'd be plenty of
          women going for the pig-men. No
          
          matter what the deformity you'll
          find some group of perverts
          
          attracted to it. "Oo that little
          tail turns me on."

                       ELAINE          
          (MUMBLES) Alright, that's about
          enough
          

                       JERRY          
          Oh, what's the matter you're not
          interested in this?
          

                       ELAINE          
          No, it's fascinating, could you
          do me a favor, could you tape the
          
          rest of the pigmen and the women
          who love them discussion and
          
          I'll listen to it next time I'm
          here. I've got to find a Mohel.
          

                       KRAMER          
          You should call this off, ELAINE.
          It's a barbaric ritual.
          

                       ELAINE          
          Perhaps one day when the pigmen
          roam free it will be stopped.
          
          Until then, off with their heads.

          But KRAMER, isn't it a question
          of hygiene?
          

                       KRAMER          
          Oh, that's a myth. Besides, you
          know, it makes sex more
          
          pleasurable.
          

                       GEORGE          
          Yeah. So how does that help me?

          Yeah, my roommate in college.
          

                       JERRY          
          So what'd you think?
          

                       GEORGE

          Alright, I'm waiting. I want to
          see the pig-man. Show me the pig-
          
          man.
          

                       KRAMER          
          Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna show
          him to you, and you'll never be
          
          the same.
          

                       JERRY          
          Maybe he's just a guy with a nose
          like this. You know a lot of
          
          people have a nose like this, they're
          not necessarily pig-men.
          

                       KRAMER          
          Believe me, JERRY, somewhere in
          this hospital the anguished oink
          
          of pigman cries for help.
          

                       JERRY          
          If I hear an anguished oink, I'm

                       JERRY          
          Let me understand this. So if you
          find the pigman, your intention
          
          is to ...emancipate him?

          Mr. Costanza, come in, come in.
          It's been a very trying couple
          of
          
          days around the hospital. Patients,
          doctors, everyone, just grief
          
          stricken over this unfortunate
          occurrence.
          

                       GEORGE          
          Well, I join them in their grief.
          
          Mrs. Sweedler
          
          Horrible, just a horrible thing.
          Flew right past the children's
          
          wing. All the sick children, in
          the playroom, looking out the
          
          window, just traumatize by the
          incident. Apparently, they all
          
          thought he was flying. You know
          how children are, "Oh look. A man
          
          is flying. A man is flying" And
          then, splat...
          

                       GEORGE          
          Yes, splat. Exactly. Splat. That's
          where I come in. On splat. You
          
          see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital
          administrator Sweedler?
          
          Mrs. Sweedler
          
          Mrs. Sweedler's fine.
          

                       GEORGE          
          You see, that trudge affected me
          in a very, very personal way.
          
          Mrs. SWEEDLER
          
          How is that?
          

                       GEORGE          
          Yes, you see, the deceased landed
          on my car. The splat, as it
          
          were, actually took place on the
          roof of my car. I can't help but
          
          think that had it been a convertible
          this whole tragedy may have
          
          been averted but I've never been
          the type to buy a convertible,
          
          what with the baldness and all.
          
          Mrs. SWEEDLER
          
          Well I've known bald men who owned
          convertibles. They wore a hat.
          

                       GEORGE          
          Well then it's all pulled down.
          Anyway. The damage,
          
          unfortunately, has marred an otherwise
          fine automobile, rendering
          
          it virtually undriveable.
          
          Mrs. SWEEDLER
          
          (STIFFENING) Yes, well, that is
          a shame.
          

                       GEORGE          
          Yes, a shame. That's just how I
          would describe it. Now, with all
          
          due sensitivity and discretion,
          bearing in mind the scope of the
          
          situation, I can't help but think
          the hospital bears some
          
          responsibility to compensate the
          other, still living "victim", of
          
          this horrendous, horrendous tragedy.

          ultimate demise -

          Yes.

          from the estimates that I'm not
          
          really profiting that much. They
          might be a little high, but..

          How did I get to be Godfather?
          I don't even know him that well.
          
          Just cause we're on the softball
          team and I'm the pitcher and
          
          he's the catcher he thinks we have

          (WITH INCREASING TENSION) ...Is
          the baby gonna cry like that? Is
          
          that how the baby cries, with the
          loud, sustained, squealing cry,
          
          'cause that could pose a problem.
          Do you have any control of your
          
          child 'cause this is the time to
          exercise it when baby is crying
          
          in that high-pitched, squealing
          tone that can drive you

                       MOHEL          
          Did I find it alright? I mean could
          you send me to a more
          
          dangerous neighborhood? I'm dreading
          walking back to the subway,
          
          someone shouldn't crack me over
          the head and steal my bag,
          
          'accuse I'll be lying there on
          the street in this neighborhood
          
          and people will spit on me and
          empty my pockets. I'll lie in the
          
          gutter like a bum, like a dog,
          like a mutt, like an animal! God
          
          forbid someone should help me or
          call an ambulance. No, that's
          
          too much trouble to pick up a phone
          and press a few buttons. Ahh!
          
          What's the point.
          

                       ELAINE          
          Do you feel alright?
          

                       MOHEL          
          (TO ELAINE< INTERRUPTING) Darling,
          you see where that glass is?
          
          How that glass is near the edge
          of the table. You got the whole
          
          table there to put the glass, why
          you chose the absolute edge, so
          
          half the glass is hanging off the
          table, you breath and that
          
          glass falls over, then you're gonna
          have broken glass on the
          
          carpet, embedded in the carpet
          fibers, deep, deep in the shag,
          
          broken glass, bits of broken glass
          that you never get out. you
          
          can't get it out with a vacuum
          cleaner. Even on your hands and
          
          knees with a magnifying glass,
          you can't get all the pieces, and
          
          then you think you got it all and
          two years later, you're walkin'
          
          barefoot and you step on a piece
          of broken glass and you kill
          
          yourself, is that what you want?
          I don't think you want that, is
          
          it? .. Do you?
