                             GEORGE
               Oh, what's the point? When I like them, 
               they don't like me, when
 
               
               they like me, I don't like them. Why can't I act with the ones 
               I
 
               
               like the same way I do with the ones I don't like?

               
                             JERRY
               Well, you've only got another fifty 
               years or so to go before it'll
 
               
               *all* be over...

               
                             GEORGE
               Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak 
               English.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, how about a mute?

               
                             GEORGE
               A mute would be good.

               
                             JERRY
               Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?

               
                             GEORGE
               This is what my life has come to... 
               Tryin to meet a mute.
 
               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's 
               a void, Jerry,
 
               
               there's a void...

               
                             JERRY
               A deep, yawning chasm...

               
                             GEORGE
               There's gotta be more to life than this. 
               What gives you pleasure?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Listening to you. I listen to this for 
               fifteen minutes and I'm on
 
               
               top of the world. Your misery is my pleasure.

               
               
                             ELAINE
               Hey boys!

               
                             JERRY
               Hey! How you doin'?

               
                             ELAINE
               Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start 
               tomorrow.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Start what?

               
                             ELAINE
               I signed up to do volunteer work with 
               senior citizens.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               *Really*.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! 
               I mean, I feel *so*
 
               
               *good*! I *really* feel good. The strange thing is, I mean, I
 
               
               
               haven't even met the woman yet.

               
                             GEORGE
               Volunteer work, huh?

               
                             JERRY
               What're you gonna do down there?

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, they say all it is is that you 
               go over to their apartment and,
 
               
               I dunno, you take them for a walk and you get a cup of coffee 
               and
 
               
               it's supposed to make them feel good.

               
                             JERRY
               That's what I do with him (points at 
               George)
 
               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               When did you get this idea?

               
                             ELAINE
               Last time I had lunch with you here. 
               You were going *on* and *on*
 
               
               and *on* about how you wanted to meet somebody who didn't speak
 
               
               
               English.

               
                             JERRY
               What, do you break it in with her, then 
               you try it out on me?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               And... and anybody can do this?

               
                             ELAINE
               Yup.

               
                             GEORGE
               Helping people... Of course. Of course! 
               It makes perfect sense!
 
               
               How could I *not* be doing this!? I am gonna help somebody, Dammit!
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               (To Jerry) What about you?

               
                             JERRY
               Nah, it's not for me.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, 
               it's you.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               What *kind* of a person are you?

               
                             JERRY
               I think I'm pretty much like you-- only 
               successful.
 
               
               
               
               
                             AGENCY REP
               This is a wonderful thing you're doing. 
               They're so grateful
 
               
               just to have someone to talk to. And I can tell you that

               
               everyone who participates finds the experience extremely

               
               rewarding.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' 
               like a good person.
 
               
                             AGENCY REP
               Good luck.

               
                             JERRY
               Thank you.

               
               
                             GEORGE
               Hey, what's your guy's name again?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. 
               *87*. How about your
 
               
               guy?

               
                             GEORGE
               Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll 
               make it to that age?
 
               
                             JERRY
               *We*? No.

               
               
                             KRAMER
               So what's up, Diggity Dog?

               
                             JERRY
               George and I just signed up with the 
               Senior Citizen's Volunteer
 
               
               Agency. Same thing Elaine's doing.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I 
               didn't try to warn you.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What're you talkin' about?

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What?

               
                             KRAMER
               It's a *con*. These agencies are usually 
               a front for some money
 
               
               laundering scheme. Or they're bunko artists; bilkin' people out 
               of
 
               
               their life savings, oh *yeah*.

               
                             JERRY
               Where do you *get* this?

               
                             KRAMER
               The alternative media, Jerry. That's 
               where you hear the truth.

               Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! 
               Kramer!!?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               I'm in here. C'mon...

               
                             JERRY
               Hello, *Newman*...

               
                             NEWMAN
               Jerry, George. (To Kramer) So, did you 
               ask him about the records?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Well--

               
                             JERRY
               What records?

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, Newman and I are going partners 
               selling used records.
 
               
               
               
                             NEWMAN
               You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? 
               They pay big cash for used
 
               
               records!

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, so we thought if you had any of 
               those big, y'know, old-
 
               
               fashioned useless records, y'know, just... lyin' around--

               
                             KRAMER
               Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, 
               free of charge.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Let me ask you something. What do you 
               do for a living, Newman?
 
               
                             NEWMAN
               I'm a United States postal worker.
 
               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Aren't those the guys that always go 
               crazy and come back with a
 
               
               gun and shoot everybody?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Sometimes...

               
                             JERRY
               Why *is* that?

               
                             NEWMAN
               Because the mail never stops. It just 
               keeps coming and coming and
 
               
               coming, there's never a let-up. It's relentless. Every day it
 
               
               
               piles up more and more and more! And you gotta get it out but 
               the
 
               
               more you get it out the more it keeps coming in. And then the 
               bar
 
               
               code reader breaks and it's *Publisher's Clearing House* day!!!
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             RON
               I'll give you five bucks.

               
                             KRAMER
               Five bucks???

               
                             NEWMAN
               Well, you know how much those records 
               are worth!?
 
               
                             RON
               Yeah, I do... Fi' dollars.

               
                             NEWMAN
               Those records are worth more than five

               in fact, it's um, it's very distinctive, y'know? Um, I mean you

               talkin' to me... You'd think they'd mention that before they 
               send
 
               
                             YOU OVER THERE

               They really should mention that in the 
               breakdown: height, weight,
 
               
               goiter.

               
                             ELAINE
               Y'know you try to do some good. You 
               want to be a good person but
 
               
               this is too much to ask.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, well, I'll tell ya, I'd rather 
               talk to a goiter with a nice
 
               
               disposition than the nut they sent me to.

               
                             ELAINE
               Hey Georgie, what happened with your 
               guy?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't think it's gonna work out...
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Whattya mean?

               
                             GEORGE
               He fired me.

               
                             JERRY
               He fired you?!?

               
                             ELAINE
               *How* do you get fired from a volunteer 
               job?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I dunno. I was just talking to the man 
               and he walked out on me!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, I dunno about you two, but I'm 
               quitting. I hate my guy.
 
               
               He's a mean, mean guy.

               
                             ELAINE
               I wish I could quit...

               
                             JERRY
               So quit!

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one 
               of the few things I do well.
 
               
               I come form a long line of quitters. My father was a quitter, 
               my
 
               
               grandfather was a quitter... I was raised to give up.

               total squares.

               Hey, hey, hey, hey, that guy can't even 
               go to the bathroom in

               could have them and he

               Do you realize how irresponsible this 
               is? Our agency's sole
 
               
               purpose is to care for senior citizens. And in one fell swoop
 
               
               
               you've single- handedly destroyed our reputation.

               (To Rep) I dunno what happened, we were 
               just trying to take
 
               
               him to the dentist.

               
                             AGENCY REP
               Why were you taking him to the dentist?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Um, well, his false teeth got mangled 
               up in the garbage

               What were his false teeth doing in the

                             JERRY
               Well, after he bit my friend--

               Bit your friend?!

               being?!

               were they doing in the
 
               
               apartment!?

               
                             JERRY
               Well, I brought them up there to take 
               his records--
 
               
                             TIM
               Take his *records*? Do you realize how 
               valuable that record
 
               
               collection is?

                             KRAMER
               No, y'know we took the old man's records 
               over to Ron's and he
 
               
               tried to *screw* us so we got in a fight.

               
                             NEWMAN
               It was a real melee.
