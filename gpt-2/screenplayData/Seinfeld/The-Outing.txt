               I don't know about you, but I'm getting 
               sick of pretending to be excited
 
               
               every time it's somebody's birthday, you know what I mean? What 
               is the
 
               
               big deal? How many times do we have to celebrate that someone 
               was born?
 
               
               Every year, over and over... All you did was not die for twelve 
               months.
 
               
               That's all you've done, as far as I can tell. Now those astrology
 
               
               
               things where they tell you all the people that have the same 
               birthday as
 
               
               you? It's always an odd group of people too, isn't it? It's like

               to *live*!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Because of me? You must be joking! Who 
               wouldn't want to live because
 
               
               of me? I'm nothing!

               
                             ALLISON
               No... You're *something*.

               
                             GEORGE
               You can do better than me. You could 
               throw a dart out the window and
 
               
               hit someone better than me. I'm no good!

               
                             ALLISON
               You're good. You're *good*!

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm bad. I'm *bad*!

               
                             ALLISON
               You're *killing* me!

               So what could I do? I couldn't go through 
               with it. She threatened
 
               
               to kill herself.

                             GEORGE
               Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?

               Unbelievable! She's not there.

               
                             GEORGE
               What paper does she write for?

               no idea who I am.

               Well, if it's all time, then there's 
               no contest. It begins and ends
 
               
               with Brezhnev.

               
                             ELAINE
               I dunno. You ever get a good look at 
               DeGaulle?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I got news for you. Golda Meir could 
               make 'em all run up a tree.
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, 
               so what? I mean you
 
               
               should just come out of the closet and be openly gay already.

                             JERRY
               (indignantly) What's the matter with 
               you?

                             JERRY
               That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah, you know people ask me that about 
               you, too.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and 
               I'm neat.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               And you get along well with women.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I guess that leaves me in the clear...

               I just thought of a great name for myself, 
               if I ever become a porno
 
               
               actor.

               
                             JERRY

               Yeah, how did you know that?

               
                             JERRY
               You told me that already like two months 
               ago.
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Allison bought it for me.

               
                             JERRY
               How you gonna get out of *that* one?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I dunno. I guess I have to wait for 
               her to die.
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             JERRY
               He's gonna hang around if that's alright 
               with you?
 
               
                             SHARON
               Sure, I'd like to talk to him, too.
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Jerry did you wash this pear?

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, I washed it.

               
                             GEORGE
               It looks like it hasn't been washed.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So *wash* *it*.

               
                             GEORGE
               You hear the way he talks to me?

               
                             SHARON
               You should hear how *my* boyfriend talks 
               to me...
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             GEROGE
               Let me ask you something. What do you 
               think of this shirt?
 
               
                             SHARON
               It's nice.

               Jerry said he didn't like it.

               
                             JERRY
               I didn't say I didn't like it. I said 
               it was O.K...
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No, you said you didn't like it...
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that 
               like the end of the world, or
 
               
               something?

               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             SHARON
               So how did you two meet?

               
                             JERRY
               Actually, we met in the gym locker room.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. 
               I was trying to climb the ropes
 
               
               and Jerry was spotting me. I kept slipping and burning my thighs 
               and
 
               
               then finally I slipped and fell on Jerry's head. We've been close 
               ever
 
               
               since.

               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             SHARON
               Do you guys live together?

               
                             JERRY
               (quizzically) Live together?

               
                             GEORGE
               No, I got my own place.

               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             SHARON
               And do your parents know?

               
                             JERRY
               Know *what*?

               
                             GEORGE
               My parents? They don't know *what's* 
               goin' on...
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee 
               shop that was eavesdropping on
 
               
               us. I *knew* you looked familiar!

               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             JERRY
               There's been a big misunderstanding 
               here! We did that whole thing
 
               
               for your benefit. We knew you were eavesdropping. That's why 
               my
 
               
               friend said all that. It was on purpose! We're not gay! Not that
 
               
               
               there's anything wrong with that...

               
                             GEORGE
               No, of course not...

               
                             JERRY
               I mean that's fine if that's who you 
               are...
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Absolutely...

               
                             JERRY
               I mean I have many gay friends...

               
                             GEORGE
               My *father* is gay...

                             JERRY

               She says she's not going to play up 
               that angle of the story. She
 
               
               thinks we're heterosexual. (sarcastically) I guess we *fooled* 
               her.

               Why don't you take your coat off?

               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             ELAINE
               So she kept insisting I take off my 
               coat. I refused, and then she
 
               
               forcibly tried to get me to remove it.

               
                             JERRY
               She wouldn't take her coat off at my 
               house, either.

               Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia 
               where if you keep your coat on
 
               
               in somebody's house, the families go to war!

               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             JERRY
               So you don't take your coat off, and 
               now everyone at NYU thinks I'm gay.

               And Dolls"...
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             GEORGE
               No. Just imagine her reaction.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah...

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, my God...

               
                             JERRY
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               She hasn't seen the article! When she 
               sees it, she's gonna think--
 
               
               *I'm out baby*!! I'm out!!!!!

               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
                             ALLISON
               Yeah? So?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah so??

               
                             ALLISON
               Well this is nice. They mention your 
               name.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Don't you see what it says here? Don't 
               you understand what that's
 
               
               implying?

               
                             ALLISON
               No, what?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very 
               gay.
 
               
                             ALLISON
               You're *gay*?

               
                             GEORGE
               Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.
 
               
               
                             ALLISON
               (matter-of-factly) I don't believe it.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.

               
                             ALLISON
               I will.

               
                             GEORGE
               What do you mean you will? That's a 
               bad idea. Jerry is a very
 
               
               private person.

               
                             ALLISON
               (Grabs George's lapels) I want to hear 
               it from *Jerry*...

               Oh, can you ever forgive me?

               
                             JERRY
               I dunno... (they kiss again) *Alright*, 
               I forgive you...
 
               
                             SHARON
               Y'know the funny thing is, I was attracted 
               to you immediately.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I was attracted to you, too. You remind 
               me of Lois Lane.

               Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What!?

               
                             GEORGE
               You're with a *woman*!

               
                             JERRY
               I know! What are you doin' here?!?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I leave you alone for two seconds, and 
               this is what you do! I
 
               
               trusted you!

               Yeah, what's going on?

               
                             GEORGE
               Alright, tell her. Go ahead.

               
                             JERRY
               Tell her what?

               
                             GEORGE
               Y'know. About *us*.

               Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm 
               not gay. My name's Buck Naked,

               that...
 
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               
               (Comedy club)

               
               
               
               
               
                             JERRY
               I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single 
               and neat. Sometimes when
 
               
               someone is thin, single and neat people assume they are gay because 
               that
 
               
               is a stereotype. They normally don't think of gay people as fat, 
               sloppy
 
               
               and married. Although I'm sure there are, I don't want to perpetuate
 
               
               
               the stereotype. I'm sure they are the minority though within 
               the gay
 
               
               community. They're probably discriminated against because of 
               that,
 
               
               people say to them "Y'know Joe, I enjoy being gay with you but 
               I think
 
               
               think it's about time, y'know that you got in shape, tucked the 
               shirt
 
               
               in and lost the wife". But if people are even going to assume 
               that
 
               
               
               think Joe might be a little... (waves hand back and forth)", 
               they should
 
               
                             VACUUM
               "Y'know I think Joe might be )vroom( 
               (makes vacuuming motion).
 
               
               Yeah, I got a feeling he's a little )vrooom(..."

               
               
               
               
                            THE END
