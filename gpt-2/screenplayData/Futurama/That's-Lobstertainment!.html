                         through all my ups and downs, I always 
                         thought the most important thing in 
                         life was to win an Oscar. But tonight 
                         I realise what's really important is 
                         to win two Oscars. Ha, ha! I'm kidding, 
                         I'm kidding. What really matters in 
                         life is that people care about you, 
                         whether it's a whole crowd......or just 
                         one die-hard fan.
